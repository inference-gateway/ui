# Docker Compose Example with MCP Server

This example demonstrates how to set up and use the Inference Gateway UI with an integrated Model Context Protocol (MCP) server using Docker Compose.

## What's Included

- **Inference Gateway UI**: The main chat interface
- **Inference Gateway Backend**: The backend API service
- **MCP Filesystem Server**: A TypeScript-based HTTP MCP server that provides file system operations following the Inference Gateway TypeScript SDK v0.7.3 patterns

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed

## MCP Server Features

The included TypeScript MCP server provides the following 7 tools:

- **read_file**: Read content from a file
- **write_file**: Write content to a file (supports overwrite or append mode)
- **list_directory**: List the contents of a directory (supports recursive listing)
- **create_directory**: Create a new directory
- **delete_file**: Delete a file
- **file_exists**: Check if a file or directory exists
- **get_file_info**: Get detailed information about a file or directory (size, permissions, modification time, etc.)

All file operations are restricted to a sandboxed `/tmp/mcp-files` directory for security.

## Getting Started

1. Copy the `.env.backend.example` file to `.env.backend` and update the environment variables as needed. This file contains configuration settings for the backend service.

   ```sh
   cp .env.backend.example .env.backend
   ```

   **Note**: MCP is already enabled in the example configuration with the server URL set to `http://mcp-filesystem-server:3001/mcp`.

2. Copy the `.env.frontend.example` file to `.env.frontend` and update the environment variables as needed. This file contains configuration settings for the frontend service.

   ```sh
   cp .env.frontend.example .env.frontend
   ```

3. Start the application using Docker Compose:

   ```sh
   docker-compose up
   ```

   This will start three services:

   - UI on port 3000
   - Inference Gateway Backend (internal)
   - MCP Filesystem Server on port 8081 (internal)

4. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the UI in action.

You should see at the bottom Tools and that 7 tools are available, if you click it you can see more details about each tool.

## Using MCP Tools

Once the services are running, you can use MCP tools in your conversations:

1. In the chat interface, click on the "MCP Tools" button to see available tools
2. The MCP filesystem server provides tools for file operations
3. Example usage in chat:
   - Ask the AI to "list the files in the examples directory"
   - Request to "read the contents of examples/hello.txt"
   - Ask to "create a new file with some content"

## MCP Server Details

The example demonstrate a simple MCP filesystem server.

### API Endpoints

- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `POST /mcp` - MCP protocol endpoint for tool calls

### Sample Files

The MCP server creates a sandboxed directory `/tmp/mcp-files` for all file operations. You can mount additional data by modifying the volume mapping in `docker-compose.yaml`.

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Tools Not Available

If MCP tools are not showing up in the UI:

1. Check that MCP is enabled in `.env.backend`:

   ```
   MCP_ENABLE=true
   MCP_EXPOSE=true
   MCP_SERVERS=http://mcp-filesystem-server:8081/mcp
   ```

2. Verify the MCP server is running:

   ```sh
   curl http://localhost:8081/health
   ```

3. Check the logs:
   ```sh
   docker-compose logs mcp-filesystem-server
   docker-compose logs inference-gateway
   ```

### Container Issues

If containers fail to start:

1. Check Docker logs:

   ```sh
   docker-compose logs
   ```

2. Rebuild containers:
   ```sh
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   docker-compose up
   ```
